      <h1>HERO SECTION</h1>
      <p>A hero section is the prominent, visually striking area at the top of a webpage, often the first thing visitors see when they land on a site. It typically includes a large, engaging image or background, a headline, subheading, and a call-to-action (CTA) such as a button or link. The hero section serves to quickly capture the attention of visitors, convey the core message or value proposition of the site, and guide users towards important actions, such as signing up, learning more, or making a purchase. It plays a crucial role in setting the tone and purpose of the website.</p>
